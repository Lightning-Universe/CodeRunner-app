## Demo

Latest demo: https://01g6q1yb0qcvg42548kj2nqbje.litng-ai-03.litng.ai/view/React%20UI

## Milestone v0.1 Tracker

All the issues are tracked here: https://github.com/Lightning-AI/Code-Editor-App/issues/1.

## Goal

Here is how the initial goal for this app looked like:

1. One work will have the editor running, they'll have a template with a class method having an input as a frame coming from the webcam -- they are free to play around with it, write the code, and return the modified frame.
1. Click submit, and demo!
1. It can be served with gradio - and the next tab will show the input video, as well as the output video frame by frame.

Might change with time. :)
